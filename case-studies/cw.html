            <p>Government contracting is critical to any agency mission, but acquisition professionals are often hindered by outdated and inefficient systems, overwhelming amounts of structured data, input from disparate sources, limited process control, and inadequate visibility. Built on the Appian Platform, our Government Acquisition solutions offer agencies end-to-end visibility into the acquisition process paired with industry-leading workflow capabilities, dramatically improving process efficiency throughout the acquisition lifecycle. These modular applications can be fully integrated to provide a complete end-to-end solution or implemented as standalone solutions. When I first joined Appian in August 2022, I was tasked with designing Contract Writing, our latest solution within the suite that focuses on automating solicitation and award creation to simplify contract management.</p>

I worked with my product manager and stakeholders to propose an alternative sitemap to improve discoverability –– one with a more balanced hierarchy and intermediate sub-levels to help the user contextualize the information in each section.</p>

            <p>Because the government acquisitions suite was one of the first Appian solution offerings, most of the other solutions had a very outdated look and feel. With Contract Writing being the core product of the solution suite, we wanted to use this opportunity to push for a modern redesign that would serve as a key market differentiator for Appian. The Solutions UX team deliberately selected a contemporary color palette that consisted of eight colors in four saturations, along with four blue-gray neutral tones.</p>
