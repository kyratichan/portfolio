        <div class="content-column"> 
            <p>To leverage emerging technologies with greater speed and flexibility than standard Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contracts, government agencies use Other Transaction (OT) agreements to contract with non-traditional government contractors, such as research institutions, commercial companies, and tech startups. Although OTs bypass the rigid constraints of traditional FAR-based contracts, they also vary widely in structure and aren't manageable by legacy contract systems. Thus, integrating OTs as a core functionality within our Contract Writing solution is critical to address this management gap and significantly expand our addressable market.</p>

        <div class="content-column"> 
            <p>To support our goal of broadening our market reach, we had to go beyond traditional Contracting Officer (CO) personas and define the needs of a new key user: the Agreement Officer (AO). I conducted extensive research by:</p>
            <ul class="mt-07 mb-20">
              <li>Interviewing key stakeholders, including internal subject matter experts and contracting personnel from agencies like NASA</li>
              <li>Performing detailed policy analysis using official resources, such as online guides from MITRE and the Department of Defense, along with example agreements from agencies like ARPA-H and DARPA</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This helped us formalize our primary user persona and identify key differences between AOs and COs. While COs operate under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and emphasize strict compliance, AOs execute OTs under special statutory authority, allowing them to prioritize flexibility, speed, and exemption from most FAR requirements.</p>
