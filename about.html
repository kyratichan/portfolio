                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Having graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor’s in Engineering and a minor in Visual Media Studies, I am a self-taught product designer with quick problem-solving skills and an eye for crafting engaging visual experiences.

                <br>
                <p>
                    With a passion for anything that inspires and fuels my creativity, I have since done a mix of UI/UX, graphic design, brand identity design, and animation projects. What I care most about is working alongside people who are committed to positive change.

                <h4>Design Strengths</h4>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="p-margin-bottom">UX Advocacy</h5>
                <p>
                    I’m a huuuuge advocate for good UX in our day-to-day work. I aim to stretch the limits of what we can achieve as a team.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="p-margin-bottom">Detail-Oriented</h5>
                <p>
                    My strong attention to detail allows me to nitpick and push for pixel-perfect designs when it comes to executing a vision.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="p-margin-bottom">“Get It Done” Mindset</h5>
                <p>
                    My technical background and adaptability enables me to wear various hats when needed, whether that be in product strategy, research or development.

                <h4>Fun Tidbits</h4>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="p-margin-bottom">Latest Hobbies</h5>
                <p>
                    Recently, I’ve been obsessed with pottery and paper cutting. I also enjoy playing board games, cooking, and watching TV.                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="p-margin-bottom">Most Memorable Trip</h5>
                <p>
                    I spontaneously decided to join an RV trip 3 days before I was supposed to fly out and we adventured through a series of National Parks in the Grand Circle.                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="p-margin-bottom">Homemade Specialties</h5>
                <p>
                    I’m a massive foodie. When I’m not exploring new restaurants downtown, I mostly make Asian recipes at home, with my specialty being spring rolls and chicken adobo.                </p>
